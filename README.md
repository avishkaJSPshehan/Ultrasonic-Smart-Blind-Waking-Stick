# Ultrasonic-Smart-Blind-Waking-Stick

This project is a very basic level project and here we are trying to reveal a device that makes walking easier for blind people. This device is controlled by Arduino and for this purpose 3 sensors and a vibration motor and a buzzer have been used.

This is done by using three sensors placed at an angle of 60 degrees to each other and thereby constantly measuring the distance to obstacles. If the readings are smaller than a given value, the device determines that there is an obstacle nearby and that is done by vibration motors and buzzer sounding. indicates
